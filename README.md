## How I collect data: *'the scripts'*

### Going through all the matches

**insert_data.py**

I collect game data basically through web scraping. Before season start I collect all the links for all the fixtures of the season. I managed to separate in lists which countries have their games earlier and so I can run the collection as soon as the games are finishing. And basically I store all data in two databases.

### Generate a post for the forum

**read.py**

I run this, then I just copy and paste on the tm forum. It's just like a quick report about the course of the season.

*A short example of the result:*
