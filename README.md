## How I collect data: **insert_data.py**

### Going through all the matches

I extract game data basically through web scraping. 
Before season start I collect all the links of all fixtures of the season. 
Basically I store all data in two databases (well, my bad architecture).
I managed to separate in lists which countries have their games earlier and so I can run the collection as soon as the games are finishing.
